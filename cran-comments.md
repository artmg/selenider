## Resubmission

* I fixed the R CMD CHECK note in my previous release (which happened since
  I accidentally removed the contents of one of my vignettes, which I have
  since restored).

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* The package does make use of `<<-`, but does not modify the global environment.
