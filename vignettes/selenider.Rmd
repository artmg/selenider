Traditionally, automating a web browser, whether for web scraping or testing, is inherently unreliable.

Code is often littered with `Sys.sleep()` calls to *wait for things to happen*. Every time we interact with

allows us to wait for a fixed amount of time.

This is not necessarily the fault of the automation tools themselves, but the nature of a website.

When a website is interacted with in a browser, it will take a certain amount of time to respond.
